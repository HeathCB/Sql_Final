Instructions: In Eclipse, or an IDE of your choice, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below. Ensure that the code compiles and runs as directed. Take screenshots of the code and of the running program (make sure to get screenshots of all required functionality) and paste them in this document where instructed below. Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignments and push this document, with your Java project code, to the repository. Add the URL for this week’s repository to this document where instructed and submit this document to your instructor when complete.
Coding Steps:
This week you will be working together as a team to create a full CRUD application.
Your console CRUD application will need to use a database to store all the application data.
As a team, decide what you want your project to do. Get instructor approval early in the week before beginning development.
You need to have at least 3 entities.
Users should be able to interact via the console (i.e. Scanner(System.in)))
Use git to collaborate.
Everyone will be graded on their individual contributions.
